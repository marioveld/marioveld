ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Mario van der Velden. 
I work at [The Information Lab Netherlands](https://theinformationlab.nl/) as an Analytics Engineer.
I am very interested in
SQL (Snowflake), dbt (data build tool) and Python.
I really like using these tools to help organizations with their data! ðŸŒ±
One of the most fun things about being an Analytics Engineer
is the interaction between data and people and
using technology to reflect business reality. âœ¨
